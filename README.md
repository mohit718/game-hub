# Game Hub | Downlod Raw Games
This is a library for downloading raw games. It offers following features:-

* __Game Platform Selection:__ Users can filter games based on platforms like PS5, Xbox, PC, etc.
* __Genre-Based Filtering:__ Users can search for games by genre.
* __Sort Options:__ Games can be sorted based on relevance, popularity, upload date, or title.
* __Popularity Measure:__ Games are ranked by user ratings, which are static in the current version.
* __Dark Mode:__ The app offers a toggle for dark mode, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes.

Since it's a concept site, the games and images are just placeholders and aren't available for download. This is a good outline for a gaming site or an app, especially for users who like to explore games across various platforms and genres.
